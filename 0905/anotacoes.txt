====================== Title =====================
Quantum simulation of extended electron-phonon coupling effects in a hybrid Rydberg atom system

============ Motivation and Introduction =========
quantum simulation
sucess of rydberg atoms
recent developments enabling trapped long-lived systems:
Trapping Alkaline Earth Rydberg Atoms Optical Tweezer Arrays
Trapped Alkali-Metal Rydberg Qubit

extension to a hybrid system: mixed species increase complexity, 
mixtures, ion-atom and other ideas. 
***Natural realization of a solid analogue.

Many-body physics, superconductivity etc., prominent role of coupling to phonons. 
Going beyond effective Hubbard models. Inherent difficulties of numerical e-ph coupling 
studies (QMC, DMRG, nongaussian)

Previous proposals: 
Quantum simulations of extended Hubbard models with dipolar crystals
Spin-Holstein Models in Trapped-Ion Systems
Topological phenomena in trapped-ion systems
Quantum simulation of extended polaron models using compound atom-ion systems

=========== Topological Rydberg lattice =================
Model:
Figure: Fancy plot showing the Rydberg chain (length scales, coordinates, traps, phonons, atoms)
Concise derivation with details
Crucial properties: one length scale, controlled geometry (dipole orientation)

Results:
Figure: few panels showing the control over the band structure. flat band, some band touching/crossing, Dirac points etc.

========== Ground state atoms and coupling to phonons =========
say something about possible hamiltonians, recall KJ paper
Concise derivation with details
Figure: two panels showing interaction strenght in 1D.
